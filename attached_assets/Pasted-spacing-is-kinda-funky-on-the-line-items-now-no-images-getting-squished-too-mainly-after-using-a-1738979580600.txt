spacing is kinda funky on the line items now, no? images getting squished too.  mainly after using a filter the formatting gets wild:

Finished reasoning
When a flex layout or grid layout changes (e.g. after filters are toggled), sometimes items end up squished or spacing gets thrown off. Below are some practical tips to maintain consistent spacing and prevent image containers from shrinking too much.

1) Fix the Order Row Layout
Assuming each “order row” is a .order-item container, you can force a stable, horizontal layout with something like:

css
Copy
.order-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between; 
  gap: 1rem;  /* Even spacing between main sections */
  /* Keep a stable overall row. If you want it to wrap on mobile, 
     use flex-wrap: wrap (or none if you want it to never wrap). */
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .order-item {
    flex-direction: column; 
    align-items: flex-start;
  }
}
This ensures each .order-item is a single row (on desktops). By default, its children (e.g. the checkbox, text, images, cost, detail button) will never squish each other below their minimum sizes.

2) Give Images a Fixed or Minimum Width
If your images are “squishing,” ensure their container has a fixed or min‐width so they don’t collapse:

css
Copy
.order-images {
  display: flex;
  gap: 0.5rem; 
  /* Keep them side by side. You can let them wrap on very small screens if desired: */
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.img-container {
  width: 70px;    /* or 60px, etc. */
  min-width: 70px; /* Ensures it never shrinks below 70px */
  height: 70px;
  flex-shrink: 0;  /* Don’t allow the container to shrink in a flex layout */
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
  overflow: hidden;
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-sm);
}
Key properties to note:

min-width: 70px; + flex-shrink: 0; → stops the images from compressing further.
display: flex; gap: .5rem; in .order-images keeps a consistent gap.
3) Keep the Cost & Details Aligned to the Right
If you have a section like .order-actions containing the cost and “Details” button, you can:

css
Copy
.order-actions {
  margin-left: auto;      /* pushes this section to the right side */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}
Or if you prefer your entire row is justify-content: space-between, that works too. The key is either:

margin-left: auto; to push the action area to the far right, or
.order-item { justify-content: space-between; } for a balanced row.
4) Ensure the Filter Bar Doesn’t Force a Rerender
If the filter bar toggles from hidden to visible, it might shift the entire layout. Usually you just need to:

Give the filter bar its own margin-bottom so there’s a consistent gap before the orders.
Not rely on the filter bar changing the container’s width.
Something like:

css
Copy
.filter-bar {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;  /* so it can break to new lines on small screens */
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem; /* space between bar and first order */
}
Now, whether the filter bar is hidden or shown, your .order-item layout remains intact.

5) Double‐Check That No Other Rules Are Overriding
Sometimes older CSS rules or inline styles might override the above. In DevTools, confirm that:

The .order-item is actually display: flex; with no flex-wrap forcing images to shrink.
.img-container keeps its width: 70px; min-width: 70px; flex-shrink: 0;.
You aren’t applying a conflicting width: 100% somewhere else that forces each child to stack or shrink.
Final Example
Here’s a minimal snippet demonstrating how you could unify these ideas:

css
Copy
.order-list {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.order-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  /* or justify-content: space-between; 
     if you'd rather the actions float to the right automatically */
  gap: 1rem;
  padding: 1rem;
  background: var(--surface-color);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  border-radius: var(--radius-md);
}

.order-images {
  display: flex;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Optional: let images wrap on small screens */
}

.img-container {
  width: 70px;
  min-width: 70px;  /* crucial so they don’t get squished */
  height: 70px;
  flex-shrink: 0;   /* disallow shrinking */
  overflow: hidden;
  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
}

.order-actions {
  margin-left: auto; 
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}

/* Filter bar at top */
.filter-bar {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
With these rules in place, you should see:

A consistent row layout for each order (checkbox, info, images, cost, etc.).
Images that never shrink below 70px.
Enough gap between filter bar and first order item.
No weird compression after applying a filter.
That should resolve your “funky spacing” and “squished image” issues!
