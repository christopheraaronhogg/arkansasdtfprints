Integrating Replit Object Storage with a Flask App for Image Uploads
Replit’s built-in Object Storage provides persistent file storage for your apps, ensuring data (like uploaded images) isn’t lost when the app restarts or redeploys. This is essential because a Replit app’s normal filesystem resets on each new deployment – Object Storage solves that by keeping files in a separate bucket that persists across runs​
DOCS.REPLIT.COM
. In the guide below, we’ll set up Replit Object Storage and integrate it into a Flask web application for uploading and serving images. Each section covers a step of the process with code examples and tips to keep it beginner-friendly.

Setting up Object Storage
Before writing any code, enable Replit’s Object Storage for your Repl:

Open your Repl and find Object Storage: In the Replit workspace, navigate to the Tools pane. If Object Storage isn’t visible, click the + (Add Tool) and search for "Object Storage"​
DOCS.REPLIT.COM
.
Create a storage bucket: Click the “Create a Bucket” button in the Object Storage panel. This provisions a new storage bucket for your Repl​
DOCS.REPLIT.COM
. Once created, Replit will generate a unique Bucket ID (visible under the Object Storage Settings tab). You can have multiple buckets, but one default bucket is usually enough for a single app.
Bucket configuration: No extra configuration is needed in code. Replit automatically links your Repl to the default bucket. The bucket’s ID is stored in your Repl’s configuration (in the .replit file) as the default bucket to use​
DOCS.REPLIT.COM
. This means you can start using Object Storage via Replit’s library without manually specifying credentials or bucket IDs – it’s ready to go.
Note: The Object Storage panel also allows you to manually upload, download, or delete files for testing. Any files you add to the bucket here will persist and be accessible to your Flask app.

Installing Dependencies
Next, install the necessary Python packages for Flask and Object Storage integration. You will need:

Flask: The web framework to handle routes and file uploads (if you created your Repl from a Flask template, Flask may already be installed).
Replit Object Storage client library: This is provided by Replit for easy interaction with Object Storage from Python​
DOCS.REPLIT.COM
.
To add these to your Repl, you have a couple of options:

Use Replit’s package manager: Open the Object Storage pane and go to the Commands tab. You’ll find an “Install” button for the Object Storage library – click it to add the package automatically​
BLOG.REPLIT.COM
. (This runs the appropriate install command in the Repl for you.) Ensure Flask is in your Repl as well (you can add it via the Packages tab or using the Shell).
Install via pip: Open the Repl’s Shell (or console) and run:
bash
Copy
pip install flask replit-object-storage
This will install Flask and Replit’s Object Storage client package. The package is named replit-object-storage (which provides the replit.object_storage module). You can verify installation by checking that your Repl now has these in the dependency list.
Once installed, you can import the library in your code. For example:

python
Copy
from replit.object_storage import Client  # Replit Object Storage client
This import gives you access to the Client class for Object Storage. We’ll use this in the Flask app to upload and download files.

Configuring Flask
Now set up a basic Flask application and configure it to use Object Storage. Start by importing Flask and the Object Storage client, then create the Flask app and the storage client instance:

python
Copy
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
from replit.object_storage import Client

app = Flask(__name__)
client = Client()  # initialize Object Storage client (uses default bucket)
In the code above, Client() automatically connects to your Repl’s default bucket (the one you created earlier) with no further config needed​
BLOG.REPLIT.COM
. Replit handles authentication and bucket access behind the scenes, so you don’t need to provide credentials or API keys.

Next, you’ll set up Flask routes for image uploading and image retrieval:

Upload route: A route that accepts file uploads (via POST requests) and saves them to Object Storage.
Download/display route: A route that fetches an image from Object Storage and sends it back to the client (browser).
When configuring these routes, make sure to enable file handling in Flask. Typically, when using HTML forms to upload files, you must set the form’s encoding type to multipart/form-data and use request.files in Flask to access the uploaded file. We will illustrate this in the next section.

Uploading Images
For image uploads, create a Flask route (e.g. /upload) that accepts POST requests containing an image file. In this route, you will:

Receive the file from the request (using request.files for form uploads).
Read the file’s content into memory (as bytes).
Use the Object Storage client to upload those bytes to the bucket with a specified object name.
Here’s an example of how the upload route can be implemented:

python
Copy
@app.route('/upload', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_image():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Check if a file was submitted
        if 'image' not in request.files or request.files['image'].filename == '':
            return "No file selected", 400
        file = request.files['image']
        data = file.read()  # read file content as bytes

        # Optionally, sanitize the filename to avoid directory traversal issues
        # from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
        # filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        filename = file.filename  # using original filename (for simplicity)

        # Upload the bytes to Object Storage under the given filename
        client.upload_from_bytes(filename, data)  # save to Replit Object Storage&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

        return "Image uploaded successfully!"
    else:
        # If GET request, show a simple upload form
        return '''
        <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            <p>Select an image to upload:</p>
            <input type="file" name="image">
            <input type="submit" value="Upload">
        </form>'''
Explanation: In the POST handler above, request.files['image'] accesses the uploaded file (assuming the form field is named "image"). We then read the file content and call client.upload_from_bytes(<name>, <bytes>) to store it in the Object Storage bucket. The object’s name in the bucket is determined by filename – here we use the original filename, but you could choose a unique name or sanitize it (notice the commented secure_filename usage for safety). The Replit Object Storage client takes care of writing the bytes to the persistent bucket​
BLOG.REPLIT.COM
. If the request is a GET, we return a simple HTML form so the user can select a file to upload. (The form uses enctype="multipart/form-data" which is required for file uploads in HTML forms.)

When the POST request is processed and upload_from_bytes succeeds, the image file is now saved in your Object Storage bucket. You should see the file appear in the Replit Object Storage panel under your bucket as well (you might need to refresh the panel).

Retrieving Images
After uploading images, you’ll want to retrieve and display them in your web app. This requires a route that takes an image name, fetches the image from Object Storage, and returns it to the browser. Using the Replit client, you can download an object as bytes and send it via Flask. For example:

python
Copy
@app.route('/image/<filename>')
def get_image(filename):
    # Download the image bytes from Object Storage
    image_bytes = client.download_as_bytes(filename)  # retrieve image data&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

    # Send the image to the client
    # We use send_file with a BytesIO stream and specify a MIME type for the image.
    import io
    return send_file(io.BytesIO(image_bytes), mimetype='image/jpeg')
In this get_image route, client.download_as_bytes(filename) pulls the file’s content from Object Storage into memory​
BLOG.REPLIT.COM
. We then wrap the bytes in an io.BytesIO stream and use Flask’s send_file to return it. The mimetype (here 'image/jpeg') should be set to the correct type of the image; you can adjust this based on the file extension or use Python’s imghdr/PIL to detect the type. Setting the correct mimetype allows the browser to display the image inline. (In the example above we assumed a JPEG for simplicity. If you know your app will handle multiple image types, you can store the file’s content-type or determine it on the fly.)

Tip: The example uses send_file without as_attachment, so the image will be displayed in the browser. In the Replit blog example, they used as_attachment=True and download_name to prompt a download of the file instead​
BLOG.REPLIT.COM
. For an image gallery app, you’d typically want to display inline (no attachment) as shown.

Now, when a client accesses http://<your-app-url>/image/your_image.jpg, the Flask app will fetch your_image.jpg from Object Storage and return it. You can use this route in an <img src="/image/your_image.jpg"> tag in HTML to display the stored image on a webpage.

Permissions and Security
When handling file uploads and persistent storage, consider the following permissions and security points:

Bucket access scope: Replit Object Storage buckets are private to your Repl. Only your code (running in this Repl or its Deployment) can read/write to that bucket by default​
BLOG.REPLIT.COM
. This means one Repl’s data isn’t accessible from another Repl, providing a level of isolation. Your uploaded images will persist across restarts and even when you deploy the Flask app, but they won’t be visible to other projects​
BLOG.REPLIT.COM
. Replit manages the underlying access credentials automatically (using Google Cloud Storage under the hood) so you don’t need to handle keys or permissions manually – it’s zero-configuration from the developer’s perspective​
BLOG.REPLIT.COM
.

App-level access control: While the bucket is private to your app, your routes might be publicly accessible if your app is public. For example, anyone who knows the /upload URL could attempt to post a file. If your app should restrict who can upload or view images, implement appropriate checks (such as requiring a login or a secret token for upload). Flask allows you to integrate authentication or simple password checks if needed.

File validation: Always validate and sanitize uploads. Use secure_filename (from Werkzeug) to strip unsafe characters from the filename if you plan to use the original name, preventing path traversal exploits. You might also want to enforce an allow-list of file extensions (e.g., accept only .jpg, .png etc.) or check the file’s content to ensure it’s an actual image. This helps prevent users from uploading malicious files or scripts.

Size limits: To avoid denial of service via huge files, configure a maximum upload size. For instance, in Flask you can set app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024 (for a 16 MB limit, as an example). This will abort requests that exceed the size.

Shared storage considerations: If you collaborate on a Repl (or in a Team), all collaborators share the same Object Storage bucket for that Repl. Be cautious with concurrent access. The Replit Object Storage client is thread-safe as it ultimately calls Google Cloud Storage APIs, but you should still handle potential errors (e.g., handle the case where two uploads use the same filename – one might overwrite the other). You can use client.list() to check existing object names, or generate unique names (like using UUIDs) for each upload to avoid collisions.

Cleaning up: If your app allows many uploads, consider implementing a way to manage stored files (like an admin route to list and delete images using client.delete(name)). This prevents your bucket from growing indefinitely. Also note that you can manually manage objects via the Replit interface (Object Storage panel) or via Google Cloud Storage APIs if needed​
DOCS.REPLIT.COM
, but for most cases the Replit client is sufficient.

By addressing the points above, you ensure that your image storage feature remains secure and well-controlled. Remember that the data in Object Storage is persistent – even if you stop the Repl or create a deployment, the images stay in the bucket until you explicitly remove them.

Example Flask Application
Bringing it all together, below is a minimal Flask app that uses Replit Object Storage for image uploads and retrieval. This example includes a simple HTML form for uploading an image and endpoints to upload and view the image:

python
Copy
from flask import Flask, request, send_file, redirect, url_for
from replit.object_storage import Client
import io
# If using secure_filename for safety:
# from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

app = Flask(__name__)
client = Client()  # connects to the default bucket configured for this Repl

@app.route('/upload', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Ensure a file was uploaded via the form
        if 'image' not in request.files or request.files['image'].filename == '':
            return "No file provided.", 400
        file = request.files['image']
        filename = file.filename  # original filename (consider using secure_filename)
        data = file.read()
        client.upload_from_bytes(filename, data)      # save file to Object Storage&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
        return redirect(url_for('view_image', filename=filename))
    # GET request – serve an upload form
    return '''<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head><title>Upload Image</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Upload an Image</h1>
    <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <p><input type="file" name="image"></p>
      <p><input type="submit" value="Upload"></p>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>'''

@app.route('/image/<filename>')
def view_image(filename):
    # Fetch the file from Object Storage
    image_data = client.download_as_bytes(filename)   # get file bytes&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
    # Send the image with correct MIME type (here we guess it's JPEG/PNG for demo)
    return send_file(io.BytesIO(image_data), mimetype='image/png')
How this works: When you run this Flask app (on Replit, hit the Run button, which will start the Flask server), open the web preview or the live URL. Go to the /upload page. You’ll see a simple form where you can choose an image file from your computer. Submit the form, and the app will handle the upload:

On form submission (POST), the /upload route reads the file and uses client.upload_from_bytes to store it in the Object Storage bucket​
BLOG.REPLIT.COM
. After uploading, it redirects you to the /image/<filename> route to display the image.
The /image/<filename> route retrieves the image bytes from the bucket (download_as_bytes) and sends them back with the appropriate MIME type, so your browser will display the image inline.
You should see the uploaded image appear in your browser after the redirect. 🎉

At this point, the image is stored persistently in your Replit Object Storage. You can confirm by checking the Object Storage panel in the Replit workspace – the file will be listed in your bucket. If you restart or redeploy the Flask app, the file remains available. Accessing the /image/<filename> URL later will still retrieve the image from storage, proving the persistence across runs​

Key takeaways: Using Replit’s Object Storage with Flask allows you to offload uploaded images to durable storage with minimal setup. We enabled Object Storage in the Repl, installed the replit.object_storage library, and used it to save and load files in just a few lines of code. The integration is straightforward: the client library handles the Google Cloud Storage details behind the scenes, letting you call simple methods like upload_from_bytes and download_as_bytes from your Flask routes. By following the steps in this guide, you can extend this example into a fuller application – for instance, you could build an image gallery, profile picture uploader, or any feature that requires users to upload and view images, all backed by Replit’s persistent Object Storage.
