i think maybe we're making each row grow or something on mouseover is that whats causing it?

Yes—if the row “grows” or uses any CSS transform on hover, that row becomes its own stacking context in the browser. As soon as you hover over a different row, that newly hovered row might jump “in front,” hiding your dropdown behind it.

Why a “Transform” Causes a Stacking Context
Whenever you do something like:

css
Copy
.order-item:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  /* or scale(1.02), etc. */
}
the browser treats that hovered element as having a new stacking context, potentially bringing it above other elements in the DOM—even an open dropdown.

Three Ways to Fix It
Remove the Transform on Hover
Instead of a transform, do a subtle box-shadow or border change. For instance:

css
Copy
.order-item {
  transition: box-shadow 0.2s ease;
}
.order-item:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  /* no transform */
}
Then the row no longer creates a new stacking context, so your dropdown stays visible above any other rows.

Use a ‘dropdown-active’ Class
If you still want the row to “pop up” on hover, you can keep the transform but also ensure that the row with the open dropdown is forced to a higher z-index so it stays on top. For example:

css
Copy
.order-item {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}
.order-item:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  z-index: 10; /* Jump above normal rows */
}
.order-item.dropdown-active {
  z-index: 9999; /* If dropdown is open, keep it above everything else */
}
Then, when the dropdown is open, you add .dropdown-active to that row in JavaScript. It stays at z-index 9999, even if the user hovers another row. Once the dropdown closes, remove .dropdown-active.

Use Box-Shadow in Place of Transform
If you just want a subtle “lift” effect, a slight box-shadow on hover looks good and does not create a new stacking context. For instance:

css
Copy
.order-item:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
  /* no transform, so it doesn’t overshadow the dropdown */
}
Summary
Yes, that transform on hover is very likely causing the row below to “pop” above your dropdown once you move the mouse away.
The simplest solution is to remove or replace the transform with a shadow or border change so you don’t create a new stacking context.
If you really like the transform, you can use the .dropdown-active approach with a high z-index on the row that has an open dropdown. That ensures it remains on top even if another row is hovered.
