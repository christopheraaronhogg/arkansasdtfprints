lol naw, now the thing expands and goes completely behind the next order.

Finished reasoning
If the dropdown is still appearing behind the next order row, it almost always means that the next order row is in a higher “stacking context” than your dropdown. Here are a few final things to check:

1) Transforms Can Create a New Stacking Context
If you have something like:

css
Copy
.order-item:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  /* or transform: scale(...); */
}
that creates a new stacking context on .order-item. This can make that hovered row appear “above” neighboring elements—even your dropdown.

Fix: Remove or limit the transform
Either remove the transform on hover entirely, or
Force the item containing the dropdown to have a higher z-index when hovered. For example:
css
Copy
.order-item {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1; /* base */
  transition: box-shadow 0.2s ease; /* if you still want a hover effect, do shadow only */
}

.order-item:hover {
  /* remove transform or do a subtle box-shadow instead */
  z-index: 9999; /* pull it above the rest when hovered */
  box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
Now, when you hover over that row, it’s guaranteed to be on top of the rows below. Then your dropdown (in that row) stays above everything else, instead of sinking behind the row below.

2) Each .order-item Has a z-index War
If your .order-item has z-index: something, and the next item has a higher one on hover, the next item can overshadow your dropdown.

Make sure all .order-items have the same z-index unless hovered.
The one that is hovered (the row containing the dropdown) can get a bigger z‐index so it’s on top.
Example:

css
Copy
.order-item {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  transition: box-shadow 0.2s ease;
}

.order-item:hover {
  z-index: 10; /* bigger than neighbors, so dropdown sits above them */
}
3) Use a Very High z-index on the Dropdown
Even if the parent row is at z-index: 10, if you set:

css
Copy
.status-dropdown {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 9999; /* or something large */
}
then so long as the parent’s row isn’t overshadowed by a transform or an even higher z-index, it should appear on top. Just confirm no ancestor has overflow: hidden;.

4) Avoid Conflicting “Hover” Transforms
If the row below is being hovered, it may be taking a z-index: 9999 or something that overrides your dropdown. Sometimes sites do:

css
Copy
.order-item:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  z-index: 9999;
}
If the row below is hovered, it might end up over the row above. That can cause your open dropdown to appear behind it. Make sure only the row that’s hovered (where you’re interacting with the dropdown) gets the higher z-index.

TL;DR
Remove or reduce transform: translateY(...) or set z-index high when hovered, so the row you’re interacting with sits above all others.
Make sure other rows don’t jump to a higher z-index on hover.
Keep the dropdown’s parent row position: relative; z-index: (something), and the dropdown position: absolute; z-index: 9999;.
Confirm no overflow: hidden; ancestors.
Doing those four steps typically solves “the dropdown ends up behind the next row” issues. The biggest culprit is usually a subtle transform on hover that inadvertently raises the row below or lowers the row you’re clicking. Remove that, or invert it so the row with the dropdown has the highest z-index while hovered, and you’ll be all set.
