# Performance Optimization Report for Apparel Decorating Network

## Executive Summary

The Apparel Decorating Network application is experiencing significant performance slowdowns. This report identifies key bottlenecks and recommends optimizations to improve site performance, focusing on "low-hanging fruit" that can provide immediate benefits with minimal development effort.

## Identified Performance Issues

### 1. Database Performance

- **Missing Indexes**: The database doesn't have indexes on frequently queried columns (created_at, status, email) in the Order table
- **Connection Pool Settings**: Current connection pool recycling is set to 1800 seconds (30 minutes), which may be excessive
- **N+1 Query Problem**: When loading orders with their items, each item is loaded individually

### 2. Image Processing

- **On-demand Thumbnail Generation**: Thumbnails are often generated during page loads, causing delays
- **Large Image Handling**: The application supports up to 512MB uploads, which can overload the server
- **Object Storage Bottlenecks**: Multiple unnecessary storage checks for thumbnails slow down page rendering

### 3. Background Tasks

- **Inefficient Thumbnail Generation**: The background thumbnail generator checks all orders from the last 7 days on every run
- **Scheduler Design**: Using BackgroundScheduler within the main Flask app can block the request handling

### 4. Frontend Performance

- **Large Image Loading**: All order images are loaded at once, including in the admin view
- **Script Loading**: All JavaScript is loaded in a single file without caching controls

### 5. Configuration Issues

- **Excessive Logging**: DEBUG level logging is used in production, causing I/O overhead

## Recommended Optimizations

### Quick Wins (Immediate Implementation)

1. **Add Database Indexes**:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_order_created_at ON "order" (created_at);
   CREATE INDEX idx_order_status ON "order" (status);
   CREATE INDEX idx_order_email ON "order" (email);
   ```

2. **Optimize Database Connection Pool**:
   ```python
   SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS = {
       "pool_recycle": 600,  # Reduce from 1800 to 600 seconds
       "pool_pre_ping": True,
       "pool_timeout": 20,   # Reduce from 30 to 20 seconds
       "pool_size": 10,      # Increase from 5 to 10 for better concurrency
       "max_overflow": 20    # Increase from 10 to 20
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Thumbnail Caching**:
   ```python
   # Add simple in-memory cache for thumbnail existence checks
   thumbnail_cache = {}  # filename -> exists (boolean)
   
   def check_thumbnail_exists(filename):
       if filename in thumbnail_cache:
           return thumbnail_cache[filename]
       
       # Only check storage if not in cache
       exists = storage.get_file(get_thumbnail_key(filename)) is not None
       thumbnail_cache[filename] = exists
       return exists
   ```

4. **Reduce Logging Overhead**:
   ```python
   # Change from DEBUG to INFO in production
   logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
   ```

5. **Optimize Background Thumbnail Generation**:
   ```python
   def generate_thumbnails_task():
       """Background task to pre-generate thumbnails for recent orders"""
       with app.app_context():
           try:
               # Only check orders from last 24 hours instead of 7 days
               recent_orders = Order.query.filter(
                   Order.created_at >= datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=24)
               ).all()
   
               # Process only 10 images at a time to avoid long-running tasks
               processed = 0
               max_process = 10
               
               for order in recent_orders:
                   for item in order.items:
                       # Skip if already generated
                       thumbnail_key = get_thumbnail_key(item.file_key)
                       if thumbnail_exists(thumbnail_key):
                           continue
                           
                       # Generate thumbnail
                       process_thumbnail(item.file_key)
                       processed += 1
                       
                       if processed >= max_process:
                           return
           except Exception as e:
               logger.error(f"Error in thumbnail generation task: {str(e)}")
   ```
